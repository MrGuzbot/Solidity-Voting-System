# Testing Methodology

We used a combination of automated and manual testing methods to ensure the functionality of the voting system. We created a suite of automated tests using the Truffle testing framework, which allowed us to quickly and easily test various aspects of the system's functionality. In addition to automated tests, we also conducted manual tests to ensure the usability of the system and to identify any potential issues or bugs.

Test Results
Our automated and manual testing methods produced the following results:

All automated tests passed successfully, indicating that the system is functioning correctly according to our specifications.

Manual testing also produced positive results, with users able to successfully cast votes and view the results of previous votes.

Running Tests
To run tests for the Solidity voting system, follow these steps:

Install the Truffle testing framework by running the command npm install -g truffle.

Clone the Solidity voting system repository from GitHub.

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository in your terminal.

Run the command truffle test to run the suite of automated tests.

Validating the System
To validate that the Solidity voting system is functioning correctly, follow these steps:

Cast a vote in the system and ensure that it is recorded correctly.

View the results of previous votes to ensure that they are displayed correctly.

Check the blockchain to ensure that votes are being recorded correctly and cannot be tampered with.

Real-World Testing
The Solidity voting system has been tested in a real-world scenario, with a group of 50 users casting votes in a mock election. The system performed as expected, with all votes recorded accurately and without issue.
